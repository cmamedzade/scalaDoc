/*
By-name parameters are evaluated every time they are used.
They wonâ€™t be evaluated at all if they are unused.
This is similar to replacing the by-name parameters with the passed expressions.
They are in contrast to by-value parameters.
To make a parameter called by-name, simply prepend => to its type.
